# R-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn prediction analysis using R, implementing various machine learning models like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The project includes data preprocessing, evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score), and visualizations using ggplot2, as well as data balancing techniques with the ROSE package.

## ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction with R

This project leverages Machine Learning techniques in R to predict customer churn using the dataset `tel_churn.csv`. Multiple models are compared for performance, incorporating advanced techniques such as data balancing (using the ROSE package) and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Preprocessing:
- Dataset cleaning and splitting into training/testing sets.
- Balancing the dataset using oversampling/undersampling (ROSE package).

### Models Implemented:
- Decision Tree (with and without balancing)
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Performance Metrics:
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy
- Visual comparisons across models.

### Visualization:
- Bar charts for model metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy).

### Model Saving and Loading:
- Save trained models for reuse.
